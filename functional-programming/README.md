# What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a coding technique, and there are languages more suited for it than others. This technique is directly linked to some of the most advanced branches of mathematics, but we are not bringing any theoretical maths to this practical guide.

A good way of starting functional programming is by analyzing each of its interconnected principles:
- Declarative
- Purity
- Referential transparency
- Immutability
## Declarative
We will start with the only functional programming principle that is subjective. Declarative programming could well be the inclination to separate further and further the description of a program from its evaluation. Declaring *what we want* (and progressively isolating away *how we'll get it*) inevitably ends using more expressions and functions and less control flow and state. Declarative programming fits better when we have a very restricted and clear model for the problem to solve. And even those mature solutions will still be having irreducible or just more desirable imperative parts.
