# What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a coding technique, and there are languages more suited for it than others. This technique is directly linked to some of the most advanced branches of mathematics, but we are not bringing any theoretical maths to this practical guide.

A good way of starting functional programming is by analyzing each of its interconnected principles:
- Declarative
- Purity
- Referential transparency
- Immutability
